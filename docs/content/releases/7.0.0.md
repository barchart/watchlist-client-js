**Breaking Changes**

* The mechanism for passing JSON Web Tokens to the ```WatchlistGateway``` has changed. Consumers are now required to provide ```JwtProvider``` instances instead of ```RequestInterceptor``` instances. Here are the specifics:
  * The ```RequestInterceptor``` argument was replaced with a ```JwtProvider``` argument on static factory functions (e.g. ```WatchlistGateway.forProduction```).
  * The ```RequestInterceptor``` argument was removed from the ```WatchlistGateway``` constructor.
  * The ```WatchlistGateway.start``` function was renamed to ```WatchlistGateway.connect``` and now has a ```JwtProvider``` argument.
  * The ```JwtGateway``` and ```JwtEndpoint``` classes were removed.
  * Static factory functions for impersonating users in the ```test``` and ```development``` environments were added. See ```JwtProvider.forTest``` and ```JwtProvider.forDevelopment```.
